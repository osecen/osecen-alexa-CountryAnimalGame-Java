# Word Chain  - osecen-alexa-CountryAnimalGame-Java

"Word Chain Game" is an Alexa Skill using Java that plays the famous " give me a word that starts with the last letter of previous word" game using country and animal names mixed. 

You can easily extend the functionality by adding more words into the game.

In general, Alexa support for Node.js is much better than Java so consider using Node.js or Python to develope your Alexa skills unless you have backend Java code you have to use for your skill, in which case you will have to use Java.
